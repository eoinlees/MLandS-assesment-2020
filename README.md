# MAchine Learning and Statistics - Tasks 2020 - Assignment
## Eoin Lees - G00387888 - December 2020


The following program is an assignment for the machine learning and statistics module in December 2020. 

A total of four tasks were given throughout the semester with a deadline of December 18th 2020

It is run using Jupyter notebooks.

It can be read directly from git hub, however for full functionallity please download and run directly from your desktop. 

### Jupyter notebooks
* Installation
    Visit https://jupyter.org/ and follow instructions to install on your macine
* To Run
    Navigate to the correct folder in the console and type the following command: Jupyter notebooks
    Use the gui provided in the web explorer and select `MLandS-assessment-2020.ipynb`

### Assignment Brief

The assignment brief was the following:

    Task 1. October 5th, 2020: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.
    
    Task 2. November 2nd, 2020: The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4], stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.

    Task 3. November 16th, 2020: The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)) . However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S . The STDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence.

    Task 4. November 30th, 2020: Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set. You will easily obtain a copy of the data set online. Explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.

It was broken down into 4 sections and answered with examples. Each section has its references built in along with a full list at the end of each task. 

### Results

After compiling all of the research and information into the jupyter notebook document I believe I have a much better understanding of what it means to analyise data. It has sparked an interest in statistics that i hope to perue further. I am confident that in future work I will be able to refer back to this document and use it as a starting off point for working on problems.
